Project 2: Implementing Design Patters

Description: 
This project is about an interactive GUI implementing the card game Rummy

Colaboration: 
I worked on this project mostly alone, got together various times with the
team that was assigned to us to help eachother with problems we ran into 
along the way. I also had some help from others from my class.

How to play: https://youtu.be/wqrqlCyAHP4

Instructions: 
The project runs when using java proj2.java but not everything was implemented
to working conditions, meaning that somethings may not work properly. Also for
some reason the card images decided to stop showing up. Unfortunatly I could not
implement the AI for this game, so this is meant to be played by two people.
